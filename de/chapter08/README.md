# Free your creativity

## What will you learn during this chapter ?

* Create a team!
* Prepare a special project
* Have fun!

Students, Teachers and Programmers please form some groups!

You will have around 30 minutes to think and code a SuperCool project and then present it in front of the other groups.

Remember:

* You can use all the Micro:bits of your groups
* No limit to your imagination (feel free to use everything you know)
* Work together
* Is not a race
* Is not a race between Programmers :)
* Enjoy this as much as possible!
